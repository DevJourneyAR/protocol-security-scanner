# Sovereign SQRP Radar - Core Standard I
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FDevJourneyAR%2FSovereign-Radar-System.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FDevJourneyAR%2FSovereign-Radar-System?ref=badge_shield)


## 🛡️ Project Overview
An advanced, high-performance radar tracking and cryptographic security system built with **Rust**. This system is designed for real-time target acquisition, threat assessment (EWS), and secure data obfuscation.

## 🚀 Technical Capabilities
- **Quantum-Resistant Hashing**: Uses `ring` library for SHA-256 cryptographic sealing.
- **Early Warning System (EWS)**: Autonomous logic for detecting hypersonic breaches and high-speed approaches.
- **Data Obfuscation Layer**: XOR-based masking for protecting sensitive coordinate data in memory.
- **Billion-Strike Resilient**: Stress-tested against 1 billion cryptographic operations with 100% stability.

## 🛠️ Security Architecture
The system implements **Standard I Cybersecurity Auditing** protocols, ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector and preventing common vulnerabilities like Buffer Overflows.



## 📊 Compilation & Performance
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Build System**: Cargo
- **Performance**: Sub-microsecond cryptographic signing per packet.
